# Nothing in the shipped tree points at the private cai-platform suites (ADR 0003).
#
# (1) No "platform#NNN": cai-platform issue numbers, which a hosting platform links
#     to the issues of this repository. Always checked.
# (2) No suite id of the acceptance copy as a word. The ids are the directory names
#     under HOLMGANG_ACCEPTANCE_SUITES (one search directory, or several separated
#     by ':'), read at runtime, so the list itself never enters this repository;
#     skipped without it. A hit names only file and line, never the id.
#
# A few ids are also ordinary words or file names. Such a line is allowed by file
# and line pattern below, never by id: a new use of the same id elsewhere fails.
